Database name: 3005project2
The DDL can be run all at once.
The DML has to be run in three separate queries: the first five, then the sixth, then the seventh, due to the foreign key dependencies in the last two.

I made one diagram without checking if it was the entity relationship diagram or the relational schema design.
I built it from a draw.io template.
Either way, it should show how my tables connect.

I wasn't able to get to implementing the functions, but I know that the little code I have connects to the database properly.
There's a list in there of functions I thought would be necessary.
The plan was to use a command line interface, beginning with the user selecting whether they're a member, trainer, or admin.
After that, they would enter their password, and once logged in they could choose from a list of actions corresponding to the functions.
